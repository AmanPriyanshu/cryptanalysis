# Cryptanalysis
#### My code for breaking or testing different ciphers they will include both the encryption/decryption function as well as the attack function.

## Introduction

#### Cryptography is an integeral part of society at this point, where cyber-data is a key to one's whole life. Therefore it is essential to build a stronger and secure encryption system to keep this information safe. 
#### Encryption: the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
#### Encryption-and-Decryption are a key concept behind Cryptography, whereas Cryptanalysis is the the procedures, processes, methods, etc., used to translate or interpret secret writings, as codes and ciphers, for which the key is unknown.
#### Now the encryption and decryption algorithm togeather form a Cryptosystem:
#### A cryptosystem is a structure or scheme consisting of a set of algorithms that converts plaintext to ciphertext (Encryption) to encode or decode messages securely (Decryption).
#### In a symmetric (or shared-key) cryptosystem, encryption and decryption use the same (or essentially the same) key. In an Asymmetric (or public-key) cryptosystem, encryption and decryption use two different keys. An encryption key and a matching decryption key, due to this propert, publick-key cryptosystem can distribute their public key in the Open and still retain full privacy over messages since the private key decryption makes the Decryption inaccessible.
#### Plain-text: P; Cipher-text: C; Key: K; Encryption Algorithm: E; Decryption-Algorithm: D.
#### P = D(K, E(P,K))  {Symmetric-key system}
#### P = D(K', E(P,K)) {Asymmetric-key system}
